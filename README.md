1.Topic
ship anchor drag prediction based on weather condition
● analysis occurrence of anchor drag using given weather/ocean obervation data 
● suggest the Prediction Model Ideas for Anticipating Anchor Dragging 30 Minutes to 1 Hour Ahead
2. Introduction of VTS
3. Description of anchorage, anchor, anchor drag
4. Average turing radius for each anchorage
5. Construction & Description of Data 
6. Model Validation
● using CSI to calculate accuracy of the model(0: non-occurrence, 1: occurrence)
● Predicting the Occurrence or Non-occurrence Based on Provided Data Only for a Specific Time Period(Values within +/- 30 minutes of a predicted occurrence (assigned as 1) are considered as occurrences.)
● Include the final evaluation scores of the last calculated model in the final contest proposal (analysis report) for submission
● To prevent abuse, limit model validation to twice a day per registration number
